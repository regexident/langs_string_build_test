Evaluating Language Performance when Handling Large String
================================================================================

To investigate how different programming languages handle building large strings, I created nearly identical programs for each language. Each program constructs a string through a series of iterations, with each iteration appending a character representing the iteration number. The entire text is then saved to a file in one go.

Notes
------------

*   To accelerate the string building process, I utilized the string building feature available in each language or its equivalent. (In the C language, custom functions were implemented to simulate this feature.)
*   Only the time taken to generate the string is measured.
*   No initial capacity value was set for the string building.
*   The generated file is saved in a single batch without being divided into multiple chunks.
*   To ensure a fair comparison, I avoided using any optimization tricks or advanced features that could enhance the programs' performance, relying solely on the default language features.
*   The programs were created with the assistance of AI.

Please note that this is not a professional benchmarking test, but rather a humble attempt to explore the patterns of each language's capabilities and performance.
